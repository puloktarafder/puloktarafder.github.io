- I am currently a first semester PhD student at the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Howard University, Washington, DC, USA. I also work as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervison of Professor Imtiaz Ahmed and Professor Danda B. Rawat at the same department. Previously I was a master's student at the department of computer engineering at Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea. I worked as a graduate research assistant with Prof. Wooyeol Choi at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/" target="_blank">Smart Networking Lab</a> during my master's studies. Earlier, I completed my bachelor's in electrical and electronic engineering from Brac University, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2019. Prior to starting my master's program, I worked as a research assistant at the Control and Applications Research Centre (CARC) in Brac University.
- My primary research interest is focused on next generation wireless communication and application of machine learning (deep reinforcement learning, federated learning) in wireless communications, particularly in mmWave and Massive MIMO.
- I was selected as a reviewer for ICAIIC 2022
- I am an active IEEE graduate student member
