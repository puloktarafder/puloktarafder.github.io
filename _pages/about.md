- I am a 3rd semester master's student at the department of computer engineering at Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea. I work at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/" target="_blank">Smart Networking Lab.</a> as a graduate research assistant with Prof. Wooyeol Choi since March 2021. I completed my bachelor's in electrical and electronic engigneering from Brac University, Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2019. Prior to starting my master's, I worked as a research assistant at the Control and Applications Research Centre (CARC) at Brac University.
